**Project Description: Test Drive Management System**

**Introduction:**
The Test Drive Management System is a web application developed as part of an advanced software engineering course. The system facilitates two primary roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role involves managing the application by adding, editing, and deleting car listings, while the Customer role allows users to book cars for test drives.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core MVC
- **Database Management System:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- **Frontend Framework:** Bootstrap

**Key Features:**

**Admin Features:**
1. **Car Management:** Admin users can add new cars to the system, edit existing car details, and remove cars from the listings.
2. **User Management:** Ability to manage user accounts and roles within the system.
3. **Dashboard:** A centralized dashboard for monitoring system activities and performance.

**Customer Features:**
1. **Car Booking:** Customers can browse available cars, select a car for a test drive, and book an appointment.
2. **User Profile:** Users can manage their profiles, view past bookings, and update personal information.


**System Architecture:**
The system follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application into three interconnected components: Models (data layer), Views (presentation layer), and Controllers (business logic layer). This architecture ensures maintainability, extensibility, and reusability of the codebase.

**Database Design:**
The database design includes tables for cars, users, bookings, and Role of users. Relationships are established between these entities to ensure data integrity and efficient data retrieval.

**User Interface:**
Bootstrap is used to design the user interface, providing a responsive and visually appealing layout that adapts well to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

**Conclusion:**
The Test Drive Management System offers a user-friendly platform for both Admins and Customers to interact with the application seamlessly. The system showcases the application of advanced software engineering principles in developing a robust and efficient web application for managing test drive appointments.
